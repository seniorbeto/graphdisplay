DESCRIPTION:
graphdisplay is a Python package for easy visualization of graphs and trees. It is built on top of the tkinter module,
and is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your own projects. It also includes graph and tree data structures
implementation based on the official Data Structures and Algorithms course at Carlos III University of Madrid.

It is an open source project fully developed by Alberto Penas DÃ­az, used under a MIT license at: https://github.com/seniorbeto/graphdisplay

USE EXAMPLES:

1.->
    from graphdisplay import GraphGUI, Graph

    labels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
    g = Graph(labels)

    # Now, we add the edges
    g.add_edge('A', 'C', 12)  # A->(12)C
    g.add_edge('A', 'D', 60)  # A->(60)D
    g.add_edge('B', 'A', 10)  # B->(10)A
    g.add_edge('C', 'B', 20)  # C->(20)B
    g.add_edge('C', 'D', 32)  # C->(32)D
    g.add_edge('E', 'A', 7)   # E->(7)A

    GraphGUI(g)

class GraphGUI:

    Main class that creates a GraphGUI object, which will display the graph in an external window. Nodes can be moved with the mouse.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : Any
        The graph to be displayed.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If more than 5 instances of GraphGUI have been generated.
    RecursionError
        If, while displaying a tree-like graph, the recursion limit is reached.
    RuntimeError
        For how multiprocessing works in python, it doesn't allow generating multiple processes
        without using a "if __name__ == "__main__":" statement. By implementing a try/expect, we
        can temporarily deal with this issue. Nevertheless, by doing this, there is a high chance
        to run into code-duplication and zombie processes generations. This raises a RuntimeError
        exception, but since it is not a critical error, it is shown as a warning and the program
        runs normally.

    Returns
    -------
    GraphGUI.__GraphGUI : Any
        The GraphGUI object.
